        <h2>What is Malaria?</h2>
        <p>Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. By using data like temperature, humidity, and rainfall, we can predict potential outbreaks.</p>

        <h2>Why Malaria is a Major Concern in Malindi?</h2>
        <p>Malindi, a coastal town in Kilifi County, experiences high malaria prevalence due to its warm and humid climate, which creates a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. Factors such as heavy seasonal rainfall, stagnant water bodies, and increasing temperatures contribute to frequent outbreaks, putting thousands of residents at risk.</p>

        <h2>How Our System Helps</h2>
        <p>Our Machine Learning-Driven Malaria Prediction System utilizes weather data—including temperature, humidity, and rainfall—to predict potential malaria outbreaks in Malindi. By analyzing these environmental factors, we provide early warnings and help local health authorities and residents take preventive measures before an outbreak occurs.</p>
