        <h2>Understanding Malaria in Malindi</h2>
        <p>Malindi, a coastal town in Kilifi County, Kenya, is one of the regions heavily affected by malaria due to its tropical climate, high humidity, and seasonal rainfall patterns. The presence of stagnant water bodies, such as mangroves, rice paddies, and poorly drained urban areas, creates an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, increasing malaria transmission rates. <br> In Kenya, malaria remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and Malindi is classified as a high-risk area. Effective surveillance, early warnings, and preventive measures are crucial in combating this public health challenge.</p>
        
        <h2>How Our System Works</h2>
        <p>Our malaria prediction system uses weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall to estimate the risk of malaria outbreaks. Environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, and humidity are crucial variables that significantly affect malaria transmission.  </p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing Malaria Cases-By predicting outbreaks before they happen, communities can take early action, such as mosquito net distribution, indoor spraying, and public awareness campaigns.</li>
            <li>Efficient Resource Allocation–Health officials can strategically deploy medical supplies and personnel to high-risk areas, ensuring an effective response.</li>
            <li>Supporting Public Health Policies–The system contributes to evidence-based decision-making, helping the Kilifi County Health Department improve malaria control efforts.</li>
            <li>Families in Malindi can receive timely health recommendations to protect themselves from malaria.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><br>Join Us in the Fight Against Malaria! <br> Malaria is preventable, and with the right tools, we can make Malindi a malaria-free region. Our system provides the power of prediction, helping to save lives and improve public health outcomes.</p>
