        <h2>Malaria in Malindi</h2>
        <!-- <p>Malindi faces high malaria rates due to its tropical climate and seasonal rainfall. Stagnant water in mangroves, rice paddies, and urban areas creates mosquito breeding grounds, making it a high-risk area in Kenya.</p> -->
        <p> In areas like Malindi, factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns significantly influence mosquito populations and behaviour, thereby driving the risk of malaria transmission within the community.<br> By monitoring these key weather variables, we can anticipate periods of heightened risk and help enable timely preventative measures.</p>
        
        <!-- <h2>How It Works</h2> -->
        <!-- <p>Our system analyzes temperature, humidity, and rainfall data to estimate malaria outbreak risks, as these environmental factors directly impact mosquito breeding and malaria transmission.</p> -->

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Early prevention through timely mosquito net distribution and spraying</li>
            <li>Strategic deployment of medical resources to high-risk areas</li>
            <li>Data-driven support for public health policies</li>
            <li>Timely health recommendations for local families</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Join the fight against malaria! With prediction tools, we can work toward making Malindi malaria-free.</p>
